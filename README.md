# Auto-clicker
Python auto clicker made with tkinker


there is a lot of auto clickers out there but most of them are malware for what? auto clicking why the hell does a software that takes 30 minutes to make have malware in it i realized this when i was gonna play some hypixel with my friends after a long time and my butterfly clicking or jitter clicking is cheeks so i decided to download an auto clicker and what do i see every single one of them are malware so i just decided to build my own in 30 minutes i hope somebody makes this project better and pushes it out to more people
